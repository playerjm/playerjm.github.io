	<key>USER_GUIDE_FOOTER</key>
	<string>How do I reset my password?
Other than using the built in reset password mechanism or deleting and reinstalling Applocker from Cydia, you can delete this file:
/var/mobile/Library/Preferences/com.nnfyrbsnss.applocker.plist

What is 'Session Locking'?
Enabling session locking allows you to quickly switch between locked apps without entering your password each time. You enter your password the first time you launch a locked app (or open a locked folder or put the device into icon editing mode), after this Applocker won't ask for your password again until you lock your device and then your apps gets locked again.

What is 'Lock Device on Fail'?
This locks your device if the wrong password is entered. Obviously conflicts with Auto Launch. Lock device on fail will be ignored if auto launch is on.

What is 'Auto Launch'?
Auto launch - as its name suggests - auto launches the app in question as soon as the right password is entered. This removes the 'Launch' button.

Why numeric keypad isn't showing for me?
Make sure your password is numeric. Having even one letter in the password will disable numeric keypad in order to give you the option to enter the right password.

Any other question? Send me an email via Cydia (Applocker > Author).</string>
